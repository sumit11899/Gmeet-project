# Gmeet-project
  A clone of Gmeet website where we can organise a meeting. PeerJs will be used for connecting to different IDs.
WebRTC will be used to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media. Other Tech stacks used are
HTML, CSS(Tailwind) and NodeJS.

  Meetings can be scheduled on a particular date and time and the application will notify you by sending email on
the account by which you have logged in, to join the meet. In the meeting the users will be able to chat and work
on a common white board
